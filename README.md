# QB2023_Nadolski

Erica Nadolski, emnadols@iu.edu

I am a third year GCDB student in Armin Moczek's lab! I worked with horned beetles and use their polyphenic horns and other sexually dimorphic traits as a model to study how integrated developmental systems respond to diverse and sometimes conflicting selection pressures. My dissertation work involves high throughput sequencing, genomic analyses, and functional genetics. I also have a 'parallel life' in the philosophy of science and am currently working on a projet related to agency in living systems that I am hoping to publish this year. I love to chat about this as much as I do about beetles! Fun fact: I coach volleyball at a local high school every fall!

Course expectations:
1. be able to identify and discuss core concepts of biodiversity
2. be able to use the R programming language 
3. be able to use github to manage reproducible research projects
